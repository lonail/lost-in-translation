LESS IS MORE? What is this? Is it the mathematics of _Alice in Wonderland_?

    "Take some more tea." the March Hare said to Alice earnestly.
    "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."
    "You mean, you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing."

Or is it the logic of the Witches?

    "Fair is fould, and foul is fair...."

In term of straight-line logic or mathematics, it is quite simple: nonsense. But _life_, disconcertingly and reassuringly, is bigger than straight-line logic; it conforms with a kind of _curved_ logic which turns things around and often, before you become aware of it, turns them into their opposites.

    Pacifists become militants.
    Freedom fighters become tyrants.
    Blessings become curses.
    Labor-saving devices become intolerable burdens.
    Help becomes hindrance.
    More becomes less.

As an economist, I was lucky enough to learn this many years ago. (It did not seem luck at the time, as most people thought I had gone crazy!) I learned this:

Impermanent are all created things, but some are less impermanent than others. Any system of thought _that recognizes no limits_ can manifest itself only in extremely impermanent creations. This is the great charge to be laid against Materialism and its offspring, modern economics, that they _recognize no limits_ and, in addition, would be incapable of observing them if they did. This is the terror of the situation.
