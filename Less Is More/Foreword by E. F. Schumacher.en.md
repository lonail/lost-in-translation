LESS IS MORE? What is this? Is it the mathematics of _Alice in Wonderland_?

    "Take some more tea." the March Hare said to Alice earnestly.
    "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."
    "You mean, you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing."

Or is it the logic of the Witches?

    "Fair is fould, and foul is fair...."

In term of straight-line logic or mathematics, it is quite simple: nonsense. But _life_, disconcertingly and reassuringly, is bigger than straight-line logic; it conforms with a kind of _curved_ logic which turns things around and often, before you become aware of it, turns them into their opposites.

    Pacifists become militants.
    Freedom fighters become tyrants.
    Blessings become curses.
    Labor-saving devices become intolerable burdens.
    Help becomes hindrance.
    More becomes less.

As an economist, I was lucky enough to learn this many years ago. (It did not seem luck at the time, as most people thought I had gone crazy!) I learned this:

Impermanent are all created things, but some are less impermanent than others. Any system of thought _that recognizes no limits_ can manifest itself only in extremely impermanent creations. This is the great charge to be laid against Materialism and its offspring, modern economics, that they _recognize no limits_ and, in addition, would be incapable of observing them if they did. This is the terror of the situation.

Self-imposed limits, voluntary restraint, conscious limitation - these are life-giving and life-preserving forces. The _New Economics_ of which we stand in need would be based on the recognition.

- that economic progress is healthy only "up to a point";
- that the complication of life is permissible only "up to a point";
- that the pursuit of efficiency or productivity is good only "up to a point";
- that the use of nonrenewable resources is wise only "up to a point";
- that specialization is compatible with human integrity only "up to a point";
- that the substitution of "scientific method" for common sense is bearable only "up to a point";

and so on and so forth, never forgetting that all these "points" lie far lower on the scale than most people dare to think.

Yes, indeed, the New Economics would be a veritable "Statute of Limitation" - and that means a "Statute of Liberation".

At that time - it was February 1955 - I concluded my remarks with the Buddhist formula: "May All Beings Be Happy." How unhappy they have become since t hose "hard times," more than twenty years ago!

Straight-line logic is easy; computers are very good at it. In humanity, the most logical creatures are small children: They are wonderfully, almost infallibly _logical_. "More is more, and less is less" - no doubt about it. As we grow older, into maturity (not all of us do so!), we are able to _transcend_ straight-line logic, which does not mean losing it but keeping it in its own very modest place. And then (unless there is a case of _arrested development_) we are able to see that _less may be more_ - indeed, that less is more when you are already, as an average American, consuming fifty times as much as an average Indian.

Why are we talking about these materialistic trivialities? Only because straight-line logic tends to get in the way of _Truth_. Our lives are made or marred primarily by our personal and suprapersonal relations. "Personal" means our relations with husband, wife, children, relatives, friends, colleagues, etc. "Suprapersonal" means our relations with Purposes, Aims, Aspirations, Ideals, "Powers", "Principalities" - _God_.

The VandenBroecks have done a great job for all of us. This anthology, at the very least, shows that we are in the brst possible company when we order our lives in accordance with the principle of _voluntary simplicity_.
