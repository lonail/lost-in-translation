# Samorealizacja poprzez organiczne uczenie się

> Edited by Mark Reese

Redakcja: Mark Reese

> Dr. Feldenkrais presented this talk at the San Diego Mandala Conference in 1981. The conference that year focused on holistic health and longevity. Mark Reese (1951–2006), part of the original group of students Dr. Feldenkrais trained in the United States, arranged for Dr. Feldenkrais to present at the conference and later edited the talk for publication. Reese went on to become one of the most influential and articulate members of his generation of Feldenkrais teachers and was responsible for training large numbers of new Feldenkrais teachers worldwide. Mark has written a much-anticipated biography of Feldenkrais, Moshe Feldenkrais: A Life in Movement, which will be published in 2011. —Ed.

_Dr Feldenkreis wygłosił ten wykład podczas konferencji San Diego Mandala Conference w 1981 roku. Konferencja skupiała się wówczas na holistycznym zdrowiu i długowieczności. Mark Reese (1951-2006), członek pierwszej grupy studentów, którą dr Feldenkreis uczył w Stanach Zjednoczonych, sprawił, że dr Feldenkreis wystąpił na tejże konferencji a później zredagował wykład celem publikacji. Reese stał się jednym z najbardziej wpływowych i wyrazistych spośród nauczycieli Metody Feldenkreisa jego pokolenia oraz był odpowiedzialny za szkolenie wielu nowych nauczycieli Metody na całym świecie. Mark napisał również długo wyczekiwaną biografię Feldenkreisa, która wydana będzie w 2011 r. —Ed._

> I USUALLY DON’T MAKE IT TO CONFERENCES. I TALK TO PEOPLE and I feel like talking to friends. As a lecturer, I’m not a lecturer. I just talk to people who would like to learn something. I’m not an ordinary teacher either, but a peculiar sort of teacher who is interested not in his teaching but in what people learn. Therefore, I never, never wrote or prepared a lecture in my life. There are many people of the Feldenkrais GUILD® here who know me and will witness that for four or eight years of teaching I never prepared anything. This time I wrote a paper, and of course, I don’t need it.

ZWYKLE NIE BYWAM NA KONFERENCJACH. ROZMAWIAM Z LUDŹMI i czuję, jakbym rozmawiał z przyjaciółmi. Jako wykładowca, nie jestem wykładowcą. Po prostu mówię do ludzi, którzy chcieliby się czegoś nauczyć. Nie jestem także zwyczajnym nauczycielem, raczej tego rodzaju nauczycielem, który interesuje się nie swoimi naukami, ale tym, czego ludzie rzeczywiście się uczą. Z tego względu nigdy, przenigdy w życiu nie napisałem tekstu wykładu. Jest tutaj sporo ludzi z GILDII FELDENKREISA, którzy mnie znają i poświadczą, że w ciągu czterech tudzież ośmiu lat nauczania niczego nie przygotowywałem zawczasu. Tym razem napisałem artykuł i oczywiście nie potrzebuję go.

> I wrote this because I didn’t know what I undertook, that the name of my talk should be “Self-Fulfillment Through Organic Learning.” About “organic learning” I could talk without preparing, but “self-fulfillment”—what is self-fulfillment? I never can do anything with abstract notions without talking for days and getting nowhere. I need concrete things that are plausible to everyone, that you and I can understand, and that we can touch, see, or hear. After that, when we have some common experience, we can understand one another when we use language. Otherwise, it’s impossible. I can say a word like “holistic” and you understand God knows what by that word. What is it? I learned the word “holistic” like Dr. Lomas said yesterday, from Field Marshal Smuts’1 book. Since then I have seen the word so used and misused that I don’t know what it means anymore.

Napisałem go, ponieważ nie wiedziałem, czego się podejmuję, że tytuł mojego wykładu to "Samorealizacja poprzez organiczne uczenie się". O "organicznym uczeni się" mógłbym mówić bez wcześniejszego przygotowania, ale "samorealizacja" — czym w ogóle jest samorealizacja? Nigdy nie mogę dojść do ładu i składu z abstrakcyjnymi pojęciami, o których można mówić dniami i do niczego nie dojść. Potrzebuję czegoś konkretnego, namacalnego, czegoś co przemówi do każdego, czegoś, co mogę zrozumieć i ja i Ty, czegoś, czego można dotknąć, zobaczyć czy usłyszeć. Dopiero wtedy, gdy jesteśmy we wspólnym doświadczeniu, możemy siebie nawzajem zrozumieć, za pośrednictwem mowy, języka. W innym razie jest to niemożliwe. Mogę wymówić słowo "holistyczny" i tylko Bóg wie, co Ty przez to słowo rozumiesz. Co ono oznacza? Ja nauczyłem się słowa "holistyczny", jak wspomniał wczoraj dr Lomas, z książki Field Marshal Smutsa. Od tamtego czasu tak często obserwowałem wykorzystanie tego słowa, zarówno prawidłowe jak i nie prawidłowe, że już sam nie wiem, co ono oznacza.

> I must begin with concrete things. What is self? What is fulfillment? What is organic learning? If we don’t know what we are talking about, we will get nowhere. So first let’s see: What is a self? There are four and a half billion selves, and there are not two of them equal, neither in their fingerprints, nor in their immune system. We cannot transplant things from one person to another; they are individuals, each one absolutely unique in his own right. That’s a self. This is a simple sort of thing. But there are probably two hundred billion selves like that in the world because all the animals are also selves. What are common to all these selves are very fundamental biological quantities or qualities.

`TODO ...`

> First, self-reproduction. Without self-reproduction no species can exist. All species that exist, including man, must be able to reproduce themselves. The next is self-maintenance. There is no animal, no bacteria, no creature in the world which can exist without absorbing either oxygen, or nitrogen, like the anaerobic bacteria. And water is essential to all life, and food. Without self-maintenance it’s inconceivable that any species could exist for a long time. In fact, maintenance is much more drastic than self-reproduction because self-reproduction occurs no more than once or twice a year for most mammals. But maintenance—if you don’t breathe for two, three minutes, you won’t breathe forever after. Self-preservation is even more drastic: not to be eaten up by a lion or a boa constrictor; falling from a rock, or a high mountain, or a precipice. This can be a question of a second and you’re not there. These three “selfs”—self-preservation, self-maintenance, and self-reproduction—are common to all animals; they have nothing to do with human beings alone. None of these three selfs can be satisfied without self-propulsion, or movement, or action. You can’t self-reproduce without movement; if you don’t move nothing will happen. And you cannot get your food, air, and water without moving. You cannot avoid dangers and preserve yourself without running away, attacking, or being careful in the movement you do—whatever you learned how to do so you could survive.

`TODO ...`

> Although this is common to all living creatures on this earth, the human being is complicated by extraordinary things like thinking, feeling, sensing, consciousness, awareness. What are these things? With what are we going to deal? Awareness, consciousness. Consciousness is also common to most animals, but to such a minor degree, and the difference with which we are endowed with it is so great that you can say it’s a different quality. When I ask most people why they have to have consciousness, they say it’s enough to be awake. You sleep, you’re awake; what do you want to have consciousness for? And in fact, what do you do with your consciousness? What is it? Isn’t being awake enough? Well, it turns out that it isn’t, because you yourself can see through personal experience; for instance, you can wake up and not know where you are, and not know whether you are awake or not. You can take a child out of his bed and take him to urinate because you want the bed to remain dry. The child gets up and obviously he does feel that he’s getting up. He’s awake and he’s doing something and going back to bed, but he is not conscious; he doesn’t know anything and he doesn’t even remember that he was lifted out of bed.

`TODO ...`

> So to be awake is not being conscious. What is it, then, to be conscious? When you are unconscious, say, after a car accident, or wake up in a hospital not knowing where you are, the first thing you say is “Where am I?” This is actually one of the essences of consciousness. Before you are oriented in the gravitational field so that you know whether you’re sitting or standing, and that your eyes meet the horizon in the normal way, you don’t know whether you’re asleep, whether you are dreaming, whether you’re sitting, whether you are standing, whether you are folding your arms or not. This is one of the major problems of consciousness: to know where you are, what you are doing.

`TODO ...`

> Now what’s the difference between consciousness and awareness? Just to repeat: Consciousness has to do with your orientation in the gravitational field. Without that you don’t know where you are, what you are, what you are doing, or what is happening with you. Awareness is being conscious and knowing something about it. For instance, I look at you here and I know you are you, but if you ask me how many people are here, I don’t know. I have to count them. What do I do to count them? Actually an internal sort of thing. I shift my eyes to you, and I say one and two, then three; I count my own shifts of attention. Then I want to know how many ladies sit here and how many men. Again I shift attention. If I want to count peas, it’s the same thing. In other words, counting is an internal affair. Very funny. We think we count oranges; but in fact, whether we count oranges, peas, human beings, or anything, we count the number of shifts of attention of the eyes or the ears. I will show you some very interesting, almost incredible, things, once you know what we are going to come to. Awareness is a question of knowing what you’re doing, knowing what you are conscious of. Now we’ve said something about the “selfs,” which, of course, is only roughly touching the thing. If you want to know what the self is really, there are many psychologies and theories. My own approach is quite different from what other people do.

`TODO ...`

> Now, what is fulfillment? Fulfill what? I say that if I want to know what fulfillment is I can get to it only if I know what the limitations of fulfillment are. Otherwise, fulfillment of what? Fulfillment of four thousand or four billion people’s consciousness, or what? What do they want? Everyone wants something else. Then how? How does he or she want something else? By the limitations we can understand the thing. Let’s see how the limitations come about.

`TODO ...`

> The human being is born a tabula rasa. The minor abilities that he has coming into the world out of his mother’s womb are practically insignificant. He can’t do any of the things that most animals can do in a few days or weeks. For him, the whole thing is concerned with an experience of learning. What can he do? Most of the things like sweating, say, the animal functions of the body, he has more or less under control within a day or two. But everything concerned with human life and fulfillment is nonexistent. The human being can’t walk, can’t speak, can’t sing, can’t whistle, and can’t do anything. In fact, he can’t do mathematics, can’t do music; whatever you think, he can’t do. Yet all these things will come to him. How? He has a highly developed nervous system. That nervous system has only one quality which is innate: curiosity. That curiosity is innate in all animals; otherwise, they wouldn’t know where to go home and they wouldn’t know how to avoid danger. The only real quality that is innate in human beings is curiosity. With that curiosity one will learn to realize what time is, what rhythm is, what singing means, what music means, what speaking means, walking, running, jumping, swimming—I don’t know all the functions that a human being can do—functions which are all learned. There is such an amount of learning, and nobody knows how we learn to speak and nobody really knows how we come to learn to crawl and walk. By the time we deal with human beings, people like Piaget or General Smuts or anybody else, we deal with grown-up people; we believe that that’s a human as he is. In fact, there isn’t one of these systems that has not undergone an extraordinarily long period of organic learning, which is completely different from academic learning.

`TODO ...`

> Academic learning has nothing to do with your personal growth unless by chance, occasionally. Therefore, it is not linked with time at all. It’s a social event and a social necessity. We learn architecture because architecture is needed. We learn archeology, we learn engineering, we learn chemistry and computer science because society cannot exist without them, or exists better when it has those things. But none of them depend on or are linked with time in any way. I know Dr. Trager2 was long ago something else and then he became a doctor; he could have not done it at all. He could have postponed it another fifty years. He could have taken it fifty years ago. It is not written that you should do medicine at all. I have not done medicine, though I wanted to, and I’ve never been to medical school. So you see, you can do whatever you like. You can stop it, you can postpone it; you can never do it, or do it at any chosen moment of your life. But try to skate before you can walk! Can you? Try to walk before you have crawled. Anybody who has begun by walking without crawling already has defects and will need Dr. Trager or somebody else to help him. When you think of that, we can begin to see that fulfillment is not just a simple thing, provided we think of how a baby becomes a human being, a grown-up human being. You will find that there is a period of organic learning where you cannot alter the time, the sequence, or the length of it. You have practically no say. In academic learning you are the master; it’s a social thing.

> Let’s go back to fulfillment. See the learned things we have done: to speak, to walk, to stand, to write, to read, to make music, and to understand and deal with mathematics. You can see most of our occupations and in these find life fulfillment or self-fulfillment is a necessity. Suppose you can’t walk. You grew up and you can’t walk. You might have cerebral palsy, dystonia, muscular dystrophy; you might have God knows what. There are hundreds of diseases which will interfere with your walking. Life fulfillment for you or for me may be to be able to walk, or to be able to stand without support, or move without a wheelchair. That’s a fulfillment. If I can’t speak, if I stutter, it may be a life fulfillment to be able to speak clearly. Some people may have a life’s fulfillment in singing. For instance, singing and music were eliminated from my childhood by my father’s attitude of being a learned man. He thought it was futile to whistle or sing. I should deal with mathematics, with learning—which I did, of course. At the age of seventy I gave myself a birthday present, because up to seventy I had received about two hundred neckties for birthday presents, and I don’t wear neckties anymore. The first present I gave to myself was two years of learning to play the piano. My teacher was a pupil of mine, a composer named Lockner. Then I learned singing for three years. Only then, by doing that when I was already seventy-five, did I realize what I had missed all my life. I regret today that I did not start when I was fifteen, or twelve. So you see, it’s in all those things we learn that there is a question of fulfillment. There’s a question of fulfillment if you can’t walk; it’s a fulfillment to be able to walk. If you have cerebral palsy with athetosis it may be a fulfillment to be more or less like everyone else—which is never the same thing as being yourself. You find that in these limitations in organic learning there is a question of fulfillment.

`TODO ...`

> Now let’s see further. Singing, music, mathematics, whistling, walking, swimming—all the actions that are possible, and the elimination of all the troubles that can happen to a human being—may be life fulfillment. I have some extraordinary examples of somebody fulfilling his life. I define health in a funny sort of way I’m sure none of you do. When I say I’m sure, maybe I am wrong, because the unexpected always happens. I have, I believe, a few original ways of looking at health, not because I tend to be original, but because I am doing things in a concrete way. And you can see how concrete it is; my first definition of health is somebody who is capable of realizing his or her unavowed dreams. Believe it or not, most people had intentions of organizing their lives when they were children or when they were adolescents that were stamped out of them in the long run. But these unavowed dreams remained active in them so they can be miserable all their lives having everything they want, but still being dissatisfied, feeling that their life was not fulfilled. For instance, somebody wants to paint, feels that he or she is a painter, and all her life has no chance. Conditions are such that it is impossible. I have an example of that in my own mother. My mother began to paint at eighty, but until eighty she didn’t have a minute when she could do it. She painted until ninety-three and produced a series of pictures that many painters admire. There are unavowed dreams in many people; in fact, in every one of us. Salvador Dali—I don’t know whether you read his biography—said that when he was five years old he wanted to be a fireman. A year later he decided he wanted to be Napoleon. Since then, his ambitions keep on growing. So you see, there are many examples like that.
