LESS IS MORE? What is this? Is it the mathematics of _Alice in Wonderland_?

    "Take some more tea." the March Hare said to Alice earnestly.
    "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."
    "You mean, you can't take less," said the Hatter, "it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing."

Or is it the logic of the Witches?

    "Fair is fould, and foul is fair..."

In term of straight-line logic or mathematics ... TODO ...
